# tfbs-studies
Bioinformatics study on transcription factors binding sites (TFBS) and their association with specific tissues.

## Task 1. Finding TFBS on every gene

First we need to know that **transcription** is the process where a gene's DNA sequence is copied (transcribed) into 
an RNA molecule. So when enzyme RNA polymerase, which makes a new RNA molecule from a DNA template, his must attach 
to the DNA of the gene. It attaches at a spot called the **promoter** and his can attach to the promoter region only
with the help of proteins called **transcription factors** inside their **binding sites**. So transcription factors
are proteins that regulate the transcription of genes (activating or repressing), that is their copying into RNA, on
the way to making a protein. So the binding sites are regions that are linked to transcriptional regulation of a gene.
